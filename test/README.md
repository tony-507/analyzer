# Test module for analyzers

This module contains unit tests for the analyzer's functionalities. This is also my trial to write an automated test framework. My design mainly follows what I see from other well-established projects.

## Architectures

The tester runs tests inside different test suites. Results would be printed accordingly.

## Future plan

I would like supporting filtering of test cases later.
